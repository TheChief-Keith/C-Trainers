    char    *ch; //pointer to a character

    ip=&var;

    cout << "variable value: " << var << endl; 
    cout << "Address In Pointer: " << ip << endl; //ip grabs the address in register memory as this lines instructs the system to print out the address
    cout << "pointer pointing to value: " <<*ip << endl; //shows the value in which the pointer value is changed

    *ip = 6; //insstructs system to change the value to 6 in memory

    ip = &var;

    cout << "variable value: " << var << endl;
    cout << "Address In Pointer: " << ip << endl;
    cout << "pointer pointing to value: " << *ip << endl;

    //in the end the shows the program to step to 6 although the variable is 5.  So in C++ you can use the pointer to manipulate the value as we can see because the variable hasn't changed from 5.
